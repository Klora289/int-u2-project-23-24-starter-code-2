      <h2>Why are they facing struggles with migration?</h2>
      <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 1 below. -->
      <p>Many beetles have lost the ability to fly which makes migrating southward during colder months harder. Additionally, to survive and reproduce, they require a warm and moist environment with plenty of food such as flower nectars, small insects and carrions. </p>

      <h2>What is the concept of island biography?      </h2>
      <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 2 below. -->
      <p>The idea of island biography is providing migrating animals small ecosystems on their way to the final destination that allow them to survive. It’s like when humans go on a long road trip, they stop by gas stations to replenish gas, buy food or temporarily stop at motels.      </p>

      <h2> How can we help them? </h2>
      <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 3 below. -->
      <p> A very budget friendly way to help the beetles is by starting a compost bin in your own yard! Starting a compost can take as little as $0 - $50. You can start by finding a large wood box and store organic waste there. Everytime you finish a banana, you can throw the peel in there, everytime you make mashed potatoes, you can throw the potato skin in there, even your pets can contribute by bringing you some of their rodent friends! Even though compost bins only create a relatively small “island”, the diverse food source will summon a good amount of biodiversity.      </p>
